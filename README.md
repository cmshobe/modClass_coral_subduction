# modClass_coral_subduction

FOR KATHERINE (WEEK 3 REVIEWER)
Hi Katherine, this file is self contained, so all you need is
the shobe_coral_evolution_v2.py file.
To run a Python script like this, it is probably easiest done by 
navigating in your terminal to the folder you have the script in,
and then typing (without quotes) 'python shobe_coral_evolution_v2.py'

If it doesn't run, that's likely because some of the dependencies 
aren't installed on your computer, in which case I can show you the
model in class.

Thanks!

Charlie
